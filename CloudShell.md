In this section, we will walk through how to get started using the Azure Cloud Shell. If you have a local SSH capable CLI, it may be preferable to use that; if not, follow the following steps:

1. Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to https://shell.azure.com.
1. When prompted to select a directory, select the directory in which you will create the resources required for the remainder of the workshop.
